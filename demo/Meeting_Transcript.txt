Meera: Good morning, everyone. Let’s begin with a quick update. We’re two weeks from the field demo at Powai, so today we need to finalize the flight plan workflow and integration tasks.

Ashutosh: From the avionics side, the autopilot tuning is 90% done. The altitude hold is stable, but we’re still seeing minor oscillations in yaw during rapid turns. I suspect the PID derivative term is slightly too high.

Rohan: Could that be because of the new propellers? These 16-inch T-Motor props have slightly higher inertial loading.

Ashutosh: Yes, that’s possible. I’ll run a quick sweep today evening. If needed, I’ll retune the yaw PID using the SITL log replay before testing on the actual quad.

Priya: On the software side, the path-planning module is ready. The SAR mode now supports “maximum coverage” and “grid adaptive search”—the latter automatically increases grid resolution when low-confidence detections are found.

Meera: Great. Any blockers?

Priya: Integration with the thermal camera API is pending. The SDK we received last week is unstable—sometimes the temperature reading freezes after 3–4 minutes. I’ve contacted the vendor.

Meera: How critical is that?

Priya: For SRO mode it’s essential. The visual camera works, but the thermal camera is needed for detecting trapped individuals at night or through dust.

Rohan: Hardware-wise, the mounting bracket for the thermal camera is done. I need confirmation today so I can finish the vibration damping pads.

Ashutosh: Once Priya finishes the integration patch, I can validate the MAVLink payload streaming. Should take half a day.

Meera: Good. What about battery endurance?

Rohan: With the current Orange 6S 10,000 mAh packs, we get around 22 minutes with full payload. If we remove the spotlight module, we can push it to 26 minutes.

Meera: For the demo, we keep the spotlight. It’s part of the requirement.

Ashutosh: Understood. I’ll optimize the hover point to avoid unnecessary power spikes during searching.

Priya: Also, I have a small update—the real-time map UI now shows confidence heatmaps for detected anomalies. Should help the operators during missions.

Meera: Perfect. Next, milestones. By Friday, I need:

Closed-loop flight test of grid search mode

Thermal camera integration

Updated endurance report

Demo-ready UI

Ashutosh: I can deliver #1 and help with #2.

Priya: I’ll finish #2 and #4.

Rohan: #3 is on me. I’ll run three full flight cycles tomorrow.

Meera: Great. Any risks we should flag?

Ashutosh: If the wind is too strong on demo day, the yaw oscillations might worsen. But once tuning is complete, we should be safe.

Priya: Only risk is the thermal SDK. If the vendor doesn’t respond today, we’ll write a wrapper to auto-restart the API when values freeze.

Meera: Good workaround. Okay, let’s close. Next sync is on Saturday at 5 PM. Thanks everyone.
